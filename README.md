# Zealous Godot Demos

A random complication of prototypes, tests and exercises using the Godot game engine by ZQF.

If you are not me and reading this, expect nothing particularly complete (or even functional), but maybe useful for reference.

--------------------------------------------------

## Primary

### Punch Bot

3D beat'em up platformer thing

### Bullet Slash

A top down 2.5D melee combat demo.

### Sticky Knight

2d platformer. Started as a NES Ninja Gaiden clone it became experimentation with walking on walls/ceilings and directional attacks.

### Carry the Torch

First experimentation with 3D movement involving wall running, ramps, gliding, switching of player control regimes etc. Janky, glitchy, full of bugs... just plain broken really!

### Environment tests

Contains various small and isolated scene or gfx exercises.

### First FPS 1

An attempt at a beginner tutorial example - Ultra-basic FPS movement implementation.

--------------------------------------------------

## Secondary/dropped

### Enchanted Rug - Abandoned

Experimentation with hovering/flying movement in 3D.

### Ghastly Shank - Abandoned

First person melee combat test. Dropped in favour of Bullet Slash instead.

### Run N Gun

Top down 2D test.

### Fauxoom - Abandoned

Dropped Godot 3 FPS. Rebuilt in a separate repo in Godot 4
